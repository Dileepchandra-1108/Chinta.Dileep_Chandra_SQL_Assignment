## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a set of SQL queries written to solve an assignment based on a comprehensive **Airline Booking System** database. The queries have been written using **MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE** and are structured to work with the schema provided in the assignment template.

The database simulates a real-world airline system involving bookings, tickets, flights, boarding passes, aircrafts, and airports.

* `airlines_data_airports.sql`
* `airlines_data_boarding_passes.sql`
* `airlines_data_bookings.sql`
* `airlines_data_flights.sql`
* `airlines_data_seats.sql`
* `airlines_data_ticket_flights.sql`

These files define the necessary tables, columns, and relationships required to perform the queries.
